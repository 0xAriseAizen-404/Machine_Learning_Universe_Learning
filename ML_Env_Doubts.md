I have created a folder in my system as "Machine_Learning_Universe"
now i want to practice create anything about ML only in this folder understand
whether it is practice or projects or ml apps anything i would do in this
now i have do things on python right as my system is a fedora linux system - python comes with it right
but now if i am gonna install any packages in future for any ml projects
then i do not want to install those on my home directory like system directory
instead i want a virtual environment which stores all these things
now
i can create Conda virtual environment right
now any package i install will store in "Machine_Learning_Universe" folder with a "myenv" folder right
so now this folder with python packages will throughout used for any proejcts i create in future in this only folder right
lets just say i didnt delete this myenv folder with some packages
now i have a project that i created on Machine_Learning_Universe/Day23/MLStreamLitprojects/Project1_TODO
now if i have to install some new packages in thsi project1TODO
then i terminal i have to activate Machine_Learning_Universe/myenv/scripts/activate
now if i need to install any packages then i should maintain two terminals right
one for - /home/mrxMachine_Learning_Universe/Day23/MLStreamLitprojects/Project1_TODO -> to do any actions like running the app or stopping or localhost port etc..
another one for - /home/mrx/Machine_Learning_Universe -> for installing packages right
now if i am running the project1Todo then it takes the packages from the activated environment right
there wont be any problems in future right

You're thinking in the right direction overall, and it‚Äôs great that you're planning your environment setup carefully. Let's go through and clarify everything step-by-step:

---

### ‚úÖ **1. Base folder for all ML work**

You're using:

```
~/Machine_Learning_Universe/
```

as your **central directory** for _all_ Machine Learning-related projects. Good structure.

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Using Python on Fedora**

Fedora comes with Python pre-installed, and that‚Äôs fine. But for your projects, it‚Äôs good practice **not to install packages globally**, so you‚Äôre opting for a **virtual environment** ‚Äî perfect.

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Virtual environment inside `Machine_Learning_Universe`**

You want to create a virtual environment (say, using **Conda**) inside this directory:

```
~/Machine_Learning_Universe/myenv/
```

That means:

- All packages you install (like `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `streamlit`, etc.) will go inside this environment.
- This environment will be shared across **all sub-projects** in `Machine_Learning_Universe/`.

That works fine. ‚úÖ

---

### ‚úÖ **4. Project folder example**

Your project is in:

```
~/Machine_Learning_Universe/Day23/MLStreamLitprojects/Project1_TODO/
```

If you're working on this project, you‚Äôll:

1. **Activate** the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source ~/Machine_Learning_Universe/myenv/bin/activate
   ```

   > Note: On Linux, Conda or virtualenv environments usually have `bin/activate` (not `Scripts/activate` ‚Äî that's for Windows).

2. Then **run your project** from inside the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Machine_Learning_Universe/Day23/MLStreamLitprojects/Project1_TODO/
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

That‚Äôs it. You **don‚Äôt need two terminals**.

---

### ‚ùå **Misconception: Keeping two terminals**

You mentioned:

> one terminal for installing packages, another for running

You **don‚Äôt need two terminals**. Once you activate the environment in _any terminal_, you're free to:

- Install packages
- Run projects
- Access Python or Jupyter

All in the **same terminal**, as long as the environment is activated.

---

### ‚úÖ **5. Installing packages for `Project1_TODO`**

If you're inside:

```
~/Machine_Learning_Universe/Day23/MLStreamLitprojects/Project1_TODO/
```

and you've already run:

```bash
source ~/Machine_Learning_Universe/myenv/bin/activate
```

Then you can install packages **right there**:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

The package goes into:

```
~/Machine_Learning_Universe/myenv/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages/
```

and will be usable in **all** projects that use this environment.

---

### üîê **6. Will there be problems in future?**

Not unless:

- You **delete** the `myenv/` folder
- You accidentally install conflicting versions of packages
- You switch projects that need **very different versions** of dependencies

---

### üõ† Tip: Use `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`

Keep a record of installed packages:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Or with Conda:

```bash
conda env export > environment.yml
```

Then you (or others) can recreate the environment easily in the future.

cd ~/Documents/Code/Machine_Learning_Universe
conda create -n myenv python=3.10
ln -s ~/miniconda3/envs/myenv ./myenv
conda activate myenv

Absolutely ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **complete, organized list** of all the key commands we‚Äôve discussed so far for setting up and managing your Conda-based Machine Learning environment inside your `Machine_Learning_Universe` folder.

---

## ‚úÖ **1. Install Miniconda (Linux)**

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
source ~/.bashrc     # reload to activate conda in terminal
```

---

## ‚úÖ **2. Disable auto-activation of base env (optional)**

```bash
conda config --set auto_activate_base false
```

---

## üß® PROBLEM: **Ugly prompt when using path-based Conda environments**

### ‚ùìWhat you did:

You created an environment like this:

```bash
conda create -p ./myenv python=3.10
```

This creates the environment **in your current folder**, and stores it at:

```
~/Documents/Code/Machine_Learning_Universe/myenv/
```

Then you activated it:

```bash
conda activate ./myenv
```

### ‚ùóWhat happened:

Your terminal prompt showed this:

```
(/home/mrx/Documents/Code/Machine_Learning_Universe/myenv) mrx@mrx-quantx:~$
```

This is:

- ‚úÖ Correct behavior for path-based envs
- ‚ùå Annoying and messy in the terminal

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Use **named environments** instead

Instead of `-p ./myenv`, use:

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.10
```

This stores the environment in Conda's default location:

```
~/miniconda3/envs/myenv/
```

When you activate it:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

The prompt is clean:

```
(myenv) mrx@mrx-quantx:~$
```

---

## üòê BUT... Now it‚Äôs not in your ML folder

You're organizing all ML work inside:

```
~/Documents/Code/Machine_Learning_Universe/
```

So you wanted the environment to live **inside that folder**, not hidden in `~/miniconda3/envs/`.

---

## ‚úÖ FINAL WORKAROUND: Use symlink to get **both** benefits

Here‚Äôs the exact working setup:

### ‚úÖ Commands

```bash
# Step into your ML universe
cd ~/Documents/Code/Machine_Learning_Universe

# Create environment by name (clean prompt)
conda create -n myenv python=3.10

# Create a visible link in your folder
ln -s ~/miniconda3/envs/myenv ./myenv

# Activate normally
conda activate myenv
```

### ‚úÖ Result

- Your prompt is now:

  ```
  (myenv)
  ```

- Your folder shows:

  ```
  Machine_Learning_Universe/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Day23/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ML_Env_Doubts.md
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myenv  -> symlink to ~/miniconda3/envs/myenv/
  ```

Best of both worlds:

- Clean environment name in prompt ‚úÖ
- Environment "visible" inside your ML folder ‚úÖ

---

## ‚úÖ **3. Create a named Conda environment**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Code/Machine_Learning_Universe
conda create -n myenv python=3.10
```

---

## ‚úÖ **4. Create a symlink to show the env inside your project folder**

```bash
ln -s ~/miniconda3/envs/myenv ./myenv
```

> This creates: `Machine_Learning_Universe/myenv ‚Üí ~/miniconda3/envs/myenv`

---

## ‚úÖ **5. Activate and deactivate the environment**

```bash
conda activate myenv
# Do your work, install packages, run apps etc.
conda deactivate
```

---

## ‚úÖ **6. Install packages inside the environment**

```bash
pip install streamlit
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
```

---

## ‚úÖ **7. Run a project using this environment**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Code/Machine_Learning_Universe/Day23/MLStreamLitprojects/Project1_TODO
conda activate myenv
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## ‚úÖ **8. List environments and check paths**

```bash
conda env list
```

---

## ‚úÖ **9. Delete only the symlink (safe)**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Code/Machine_Learning_Universe
rm myenv
```

> This does **not** delete the actual environment, only the symlink.

---

## ‚ùå **10. (Danger) Delete the actual environment**

```bash
conda remove -n myenv --all
```

Or if you used a path-based environment:

```bash
conda remove -p ./myenv --all
```

---

## ‚úÖ **11. Recreate the symlink if needed**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Code/Machine_Learning_Universe
ln -s ~/miniconda3/envs/myenv ./myenv
```

---

## üß† Bonus (optional): Customize prompt manually (advanced)

To override how the Conda env name looks in your prompt (not usually needed if you use `-n`), edit your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export CONDA_CHANGEPS1=false
PS1='(myenv) \u@\h:\w\$ '
```

Then reload:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

---

---

Yeah, that long `/home/mrx/Documents/.../env` prefix is Conda being overly explicit because you created the environment with `--prefix ./env`.

By default, Conda displays the **full absolute path** for "prefix-based" envs, instead of the short name it uses for "named" envs.

---

## 3 ways to make it short like `(env)`

### **Option 1: Use `venv` instead of Conda for per-project envs**

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Activation will give you `(env)` by default ‚Äî nice and short.

---

### **Option 2: Give Conda env a name instead of prefix**

```bash
conda create -n envname python=3.10
conda activate envname
```

That way Conda just shows `(envname)`.

Downside: This puts the env in Conda‚Äôs global env directory, not inside the project folder (you‚Äôd have to remember to delete it if you remove the project).

---

### **Option 3: Keep prefix env but shorten the prompt**

You can tell Conda to only show the last part of the path:

```bash
conda config --set env_prompt '({name})'
```

Now even if your env is `/long/path/to/project/env`, it will just show `(env)` when activated.

---

If you want **per-project environments + short names**, the cleanest combo is:

- Create with `--prefix ./env` (keeps env inside project)
- Set `env_prompt` to `({name})` so prompt is short.

```python
cd ~/Documents/Code/ProjectName
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windowsz
```

```python
pip install flask
pip list
pip freeze > requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```python
cd ~/Documents/Code/ProjectName
conda create --prefix ./env python=3.10 -> local
conda create -n env python=3.10 -> global
conda activate ./env -> activate
```

```python
conda deactivate -> deactivate
```

```python
conda config --set env_prompt '({name})' -> if prefix is long then use this
```

```python
conda install flask -> install packages not recommeneded as it install those Lib Packages -> use PIP
conda list

conda env export > environment.yml -> export all types of packages like Lib, Conda, Pip
conda env export --from-history > environment.yml -> only export installed packages through conda

conda env create --prefix ./env -f environment.yml -> Local
conda env create -f environment.yml -> Global -> similar like pip install -r requirements.txt - do inside activated env
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
```
